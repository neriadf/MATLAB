# baby_cry_processing
The mini-project contains four audio files of baby cries, and a MATLAB .mlx script file.

The purpose of the project is observing baby cries in the time domain and in the
frequency domain in order to identify patterns. 

Some may conclude that in time domain, a baby cry is characterised by arrow shaped pulses,
and in frequency domain, a baby cry is characterised by several shared frequencies.
Common frequencies are between 0.5MHz and 7MHz.

The raw data is very small, so no real conclusions can be made, but instead one can
use the script to start and observe different audio files in time and frequency domains.
